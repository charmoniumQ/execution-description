\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

A computational experiment is reproducible if another team using the
same experimental infrastructure can make a measurement that concurs
with the original. Investing in reproducibility can improve
trustworthiness of scientific results, unlock productivity, and enable
reusability and community support\cite{ivie2018reproducibility}. In
practice, reproducers often need to manually work with the code to see
how to build necessary libraries, configure parameters, find data, and
invoke the experiment; it is not \emph{automatic}.

In this work, we consider the use of specification languages that would
provide machine-readable metadata on how to interact with a piece of
software. It is not enough for the language to merely contain a run
command in a heap of other commands; e.g., a Makefile which defines a
rule for executing the experiment alongside rules for compiling
intermediate pieces is not sufficient, because there is no
machine-readable way to know which of the Make rules executes the
experiment. Being able to automatically identifying the ``main'' command
which executes the experiment, for instance, would be very useful for
those seeking to reproduce results from past experiments or reusing
experiments to address new use cases. Moreover, from a research
perspective, having a standardized way to run many different codes at
scale would open new avenues for data mining research on reproducibility
(c.f., \cite{collberg_repeatability_2016}).

\hypertarget{how-to-get-automatic-reproducibility}{%
\section{How to get automatic
reproducibility}\label{how-to-get-automatic-reproducibility}}

This is not the final proposal for the complete vocabulary; the
peer-review process is not well-suited to iterate on technical details.
The point of this article is to argue that the community should spend
effort developing this vocabulary.

\hypertarget{semantic-web}{%
\subsection{Semantic web}\label{semantic-web}}

This language could be implemented as a vocabulary for linked data in
the semantic web. Linked data is preferrable for these reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Linked data is open to extensions.
\item
  It is possible to link to other resources in linked data.
\item
  There is already a rich set of ontologies for describing digital and
  physical resources (RO-crate, wf4prov, software project description,
  scientific hypotheses, CiTO) in linked data.
\item
  There is already a rich ecosystem for authoring ontologies and
  validating documents within those ontologies.
\end{enumerate}

Linked data is already used for other long-term preservation standards,
such as RO-crate and Bio.

\hypertarget{language-description}{%
\subsection{Language description}\label{language-description}}

At a very basic level, one could have commands and the purpose that they
serve:

\NormalTok{\textless{}/}\KeywordTok{process}\NormalTok{\textgreater{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\normalsize

The process labeled \texttt{figures} references the process labeled make
as a prerequisite using the XML RDF reference syntax. The example
depects a simple \texttt{depends\_on} predicate, but one might use the
albeit more complex wfdesc vocabulary to describe these dependencies.
One can view specifying the software environment as just prerequisite
steps in the computational DAG{[}\^{}define-dag{]}. The purpose of an
execution language is not to usurp the build-system or workflow engine,
which both already handle task DAGs; there must be some minimal support
for DAGs just for the cases where the DAG of tasks is not already
encoded in a build-system or workflow engine.

{[}define-dag{]}: A computaitonal directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a set
of programs and pairs of programs (called links), where each link
indicates the output of one program is the input to the other program.
This is the basic concept of GNU Make, workflows, and build systems.

While we could define conventions around what to name the content of the
``purpose'' tag, it would be more powerful if the language could link
directly to the claims in the publication. Purpose blocks might look
more like this:

The block labeled \texttt{pub} uses the CiTO vocabulary
\cite{shotton_cito_2010} to explain that the result of that process is
used as evidence in a specific publication. If the publisher hosts an
RDF description at the URL ``https://doi.org/10.1234/123456789'' when
the HTTP request content-type header is \texttt{application/rdf+xml},
then this creates a web of linked data. The publisher may have the
title, authors, date published, and other metadata using Dublin Core
metadata terms, for example. This is the dream of linked data:
machine-readable data by different authors hosted in different locations
linking together seamlessly. Even if the publisher does not have an
RDF+XML description, third parties can make claims about
``https://doi.org/10.1234/123456789'', although those claims would not
be as easily discoverable. The purpose description can be even more
granular, using the DoCO vocabulary \cite{constantin_document_2016},
which describes documents, as shown in the block labeled
\texttt{fig-pub}.

One could even reference a Nanopublication, which is a semantic web
description of the scientific claim. The block labeled \texttt{claim}
actually embeds the claim that it supports using the nanopublication
vocabulary.

With this complete, anyone should be able to execute the experiments
which generate figures or claims in the paper if they are labeled by the
computational scientist in this language.

In addition to specifying the computational environment and command to
run, this language is an ideal candidate to also describe the parameters
of the experiment, like: One could specify range of valid values or list
options. With this complete, one can even do automated parameter-space
search studies, multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification, automated
outcome-preserving input minimization, and other automatic experiments.

Retrospective provenance seeks to encode how we got to a specific
result. Developers can put summary statistics of intermediate results
into the provenance description; if re-executions diverge, users can
locate which stage amplifies error the most. A tool might use
system-call interposition to learn about a processes reads, writes, and
forks. This would be better at identifying and recording intermediate
results. When reproducing some computational experiment, users can check
the intermediate results to see where they begin to differ. Wfprov is
one vocabulary for specifying retrospective provenance, and there is
already an experimental plugin for Nextflow which targets wfprov
\cite{grande_nf-prov_2023}.

Users may also want to know how much computational resources (CPU time,
disk space, and RAM) the computational experiment requires. Provenance
is the ideal place for computational experiments who already ran the
experiment to put this information. This way, users seeking to reproduce
the computational experiment know how many resources to request
(ahead-of-time allocations are usuually required for batch-scheduled
machines).

\hypertarget{making-easy-on-ramps-for-adoption}{%
\section{Making easy on-ramps for
adoption}\label{making-easy-on-ramps-for-adoption}}

The execution language should seek to describe existing software
frameworks, not replace them. In particular, execution should not
replace workflow engines. They should instead be wrapped as
process-nodes within the execution language. Computational experiments
can continue using their existing build-system and workflow.

A execution description could even be ``captured'' from an interactive
shell session with the user. They would invoke a shell that records
every command, its exit status, its read-files, and its write-files
(using syscall interposition). The user would execute their build-system
like normal within this shell. When the user exits, the shell will
create a DAG based on the read-files and write-files. For each output
file that is not consumed by another command, the shell would prompt the
user to describe that command's purpose. Finally, the shell would output
a execution description.

In cases where the description cannot be captured by an interactive
shell session, one can encode the system of logic that humans would use
to deduce the experimental structure. This is similar to the approach
taken by FlaPy \cite{gruber_empirical_2021}, a large-scale re-execution
study for Python unittests, to install the Python environment. For
example,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If \texttt{shell.nix}, \texttt{flake.nix}, or \texttt{environment.yml}
  exists, then use Nix, Nix flakes, or Conda as the environment for
  future commands.
\item
  If the environment is not already set, and \texttt{requirements.txt}
  exists, use Pip and Virtualenv as the environment for future commands.
\item
  If \texttt{CMakeLists.txt} exists, set \texttt{cmake} and
  \texttt{make} as commands.
\item
  If \texttt{configure.sh} exists, set \texttt{./configure} and
  \texttt{make} as command.
\item
  If \texttt{Makefile} exists, set \texttt{make} as command. \ldots{}
\end{enumerate}

In the best case, the execution description would be uploaded to the
same repository or location that contains the source for the
computational experiment. This way it can be maintained and used by the
original developers, and it is easily discoverable by users.
Alternatively, execution descriptions could be placed in a central
execution-description repository owned by software-engineering
researchers. The execution description is linked data, so it can live
anywhere, and existing strategies for finding, filtering, and trusting
linked data sets would work for execution descriptions.

This is similar to the approach taken by Python for type annotations.
Type annotations are easiest to maintain in the original repository, but
if the original repository rejects type annotations, there is still a
home for them in typeshed.

\hypertarget{is-this-another-competing-standard}{%
\section{Is this another competing
standard?}\label{is-this-another-competing-standard}}

It is something extra users have to do, but it does not attempt to
displace their existing practice.

\hypertarget{incentives-for-computational-scientists-to-maintain-execution-descriptions}{%
\section{Incentives for computational scientists to maintain execution
descriptions}\label{incentives-for-computational-scientists-to-maintain-execution-descriptions}}

Computational scientists are incentivized to describe their project this
way to benefit from the work of software-engineering researchers. When
software-engineering researchers do a large-scale execution study, it is
a ``free'' reproduction of their work.

To get an artifact evaluation badge, normally computational scientists
would have to write a natural language description of what the software
environment, what the commands are, how to run them, and where does the
data end up. The artifact evaluator has to read, interpret, and execute
their description by hand. An execution description could make this
nearly automatic; if a execution description exists, the artifact
evaluator uses an executor which understands the language and runs all
of the commands that reference the manuscript in their \texttt{purpose}
tag. The only manual labor is comparing these results to those in the
paper. Even that comparison can be simplified, if the last step in the
execution description outputs a boolean representing ``is the hypothesis
proven?''; the reviewer just needs to see that all of these output
``true''.
